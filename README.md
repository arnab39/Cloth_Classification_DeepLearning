# Cloth Classification using Deep Learning 
This repository contains three different implementation of cloth classification.

About the dataset:
<br/>
●train_images: 60000 examples of 28x28 grayscale image. The data is of size 60000 x 784. Each
pixel has a single intensity value which is an integer between 0 and 255.
<br/>
●train_labels: 60000 labels from 10 classes for the images in given in train_images. Class details
are mentioned below.
<br/>
●test_images: 10000 examples of 28x28 grayscale image. The data is of size 10000 x 784. Each
pixel has a single intensity value which is an integer between 0 and 255.
<br/>
●test_labels: 10000 labels from 10 classes for the images in given in test_images. Class details
are mentioned below.

Enter each folder to run cloth classification using different techniques. The first folder has the Sequence model based classification while the next two folder has simple feed-forward neural network based classification using both tensorflow and only python(No tensorflow libraries allowed). 

The folder also has two basic codes for Regression and kNN classifier using jupyter notebook.
